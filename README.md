# 💫 About Me:
I'm Daniel Sutton, and I'm deep into full stack .NET development and machine learning. I recently wrapped up an ML engineering internship where I got hands-on with Vision AI and dove into how AI systems work under the hood. Right now, I'm finishing my bachelor's thesis at DTU - focusing on latent space database architectures, which is pretty exciting stuff.
I've built up a solid tech stack, so I'm comfortable jumping between C#, Docker, Rust, Python, and all the web dev tools you'd expect. The cool thing is getting to combine these different pieces when building AI-powered software solutions. My background as both a software developer and ML engineer means I'm really good at picking up new tech quickly and making different pieces work together. When you're working in tech, there's always something new to learn - and that's exactly how I like it.
