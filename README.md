# 💫 About Me:
Hey there! I'm Daniel, a software engineer with a knack for AI, a love for solving real-world puzzles, and a belief that every tough challenge is just a series of small wins waiting to happen. I'm all about diving into new tech and growing every day. I've crafted machine learning models that do more than just crunch numbers,they help uncover patterns and tell stories hidden in data.

I thrive in teams where everyone brings their own specialty and we can bounce ideas off each other without getting lost in endless meetings. I also like to keep things light, because good work happens when people actually enjoy working together. If you're looking for someone who's not just about ticking off skills but actually loves the journey of learning, innovating, and having a bit of fun along the way, let's chat.
